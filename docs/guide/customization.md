# Customization

Yarnl comes with extensive customization options. Make it look and feel exactly how you want.

## Themes

### Light & Dark Mode

Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Appearance**
2. Select **Light**, **Dark**, or **Auto**

**Auto mode** follows your system preference and switches automatically based on time of day or your OS settings.

### Why Dark Mode?

- Easier on the eyes during evening crafting sessions
- Reduces screen glare
- Saves battery on OLED screens

## Fonts

Choose the typeface that's most comfortable for reading patterns:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Appearance**
2. Browse the available fonts
3. Select your preferred font
4. The change applies immediately

### Font Considerations

- **Serif fonts** (like Georgia) can be easier to read for long text
- **Sans-serif fonts** (like Open Sans) feel modern and clean
- **Monospace fonts** are great if your patterns use aligned columns

## Mascots

Because crafting should be fun! Yarnl includes optional mascot characters that appear throughout the interface.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Appearance**
2. Choose your mascot
3. Enjoy their company while you craft

:::note
Don't want a mascot? You can disable them entirely in the same settings menu.
