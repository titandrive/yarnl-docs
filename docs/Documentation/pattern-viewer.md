# Pattern Viewer

The Pattern Viewer is where you'll spend most of your time in Yarnl. It provides a clean reading experience with built-in tools to track your progress.

## Opening a Pattern

1. Go to your **Library**
2. Click on any pattern
3. The Pattern Viewer opens

For PDFs, Yarnl remembers your last page position automatically.

## Row Counters

Row counters help you keep track of where you are in a pattern.

### Creating a Counter

1. Click **Add Counter** in the viewer
2. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Body", "Left Arm", "Border")
3. The counter starts at 0

### Using Counters

- **Increment:** Click the **+** button or use your keyboard shortcut
- **Decrement:** Click the **-** button (for when you miscount)
- **Reset:** Click the reset icon to start over

### Multiple Counters

Create as many counters as you need for complex patterns:

| Counter | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Main | Track the current row/round |
| Body | Body section progress |
| Sleeves | Track each sleeve separately |
| Repeat | Count pattern repeats within a row |

:::tip Working on Multiple Sections
If a pattern has you alternate between sections (like a sweater body and sleeves), create a counter for each. Switch between them as you work without losing your place.
:::

### Counter Persistence

All counter values are saved automatically. Close the pattern, restart Yarnl, or switch devices — your counts are preserved.

## Timer

Track how much time you spend on each project.

### Starting the Timer

1. Click the **timer icon** or use your keyboard shortcut
2. The timer starts counting
3. Click again to pause

### Timer Features

- **Pause/Resume:** Stop the timer when you take a break
- **Per-pattern tracking:** Each pattern has its own timer
- **Cumulative time:** Time accumulates across sessions
- **Stats integration:** Timer data feeds into your overall stats

### Tips for Accurate Tracking

- Start the timer when you pick up your hook
- Pause when you set down your work
- Don't worry about forgetting — you can always estimate and the data is still useful over time

## PDF Navigation

For PDF patterns, the viewer includes:

- **Page navigation:** Arrow buttons or keyboard shortcuts
- **Zoom controls:** Adjust the view to your preference
- **Position memory:** Yarnl remembers where you left off

### Keyboard Navigation

| Action | Default Shortcut |
|--------|------------------|
| Next page | → or Page Down |
| Previous page | ← or Page Up |
| Zoom in | + |
| Zoom out | - |

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard-shortcuts) to customize these.

## Markdown Patterns

Markdown patterns render directly in the viewer with full formatting:

- Headers create clear sections
- Lists display your row instructions
- Tables show size charts and stitch counts
- Everything scrolls smoothly

## Viewer Layout

The viewer is designed to minimize distractions:

- Pattern content takes center stage
- Counters and timer are accessible but unobtrusive
- Customize the layout in Settings if needed
