# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts let you control Yarnl without taking your hands off your work (much). They're fully customizable to fit your workflow.

## Why Use Shortcuts?

When you're in the zone crocheting, the last thing you want is to fumble with your mouse to increment a counter. With keyboard shortcuts, you can:

- Tap a key to count a row
- Start/stop the timer without looking
- Navigate pages while keeping your eyes on the pattern

## Default Shortcuts

| Action | Default Shortcut |
|--------|------------------|
| Increment counter | `Space` or `↑` |
| Decrement counter | `↓` |
| Start/Stop timer | `T` |
| Next page | `→` or `Page Down` |
| Previous page | `←` or `Page Up` |
| Toggle fullscreen | `F` |

:::note
These are the defaults — customize them to whatever works for you.

## Customizing Shortcuts

1. Go to **Settings** → **Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Find the action you want to change
3. Click the current shortcut
4. Press your desired key combination
5. The new shortcut is saved automatically

### Tips for Custom Shortcuts

- Use single keys for frequent actions (like counting)
- Use modifier combinations (Ctrl/Cmd + key) for less frequent actions
- Avoid conflicts with browser shortcuts if using the web version
- Test your shortcuts to make sure they feel natural

## Bluetooth Remotes & Rings

Yarnl's keyboard shortcut system works with Bluetooth input devices, perfect for hands-free control while crocheting.

### Compatible Devices

- **Bluetooth presentation clickers** — Usually have forward/back buttons
- **Bluetooth rings** — Wearable controllers with buttons
- **Bluetooth number pads** — Extra keys you can dedicate to Yarnl
- **Foot pedals** — Keep your hands completely free

### Setting Up a Remote

1. Pair your Bluetooth device with your computer/tablet
2. Go to **Settings** → **Keyboard Shortcuts**
3. Click on an action to customize it
4. Press the button on your remote
5. Yarnl captures it as the new shortcut

### Popular Remote Workflows

## Mobile: Swipe Gestures

On touch devices, Yarnl supports swipe gestures as an alternative to keyboard shortcuts:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe left | Next page |
| Swipe right | Previous page |
| Tap counter | Increment |
| Long press counter | Decrement |

Swipe gestures work great on tablets propped up next to your crafting spot.

## Shortcut Conflicts

If a shortcut isn't working:

1. Check for conflicts with other shortcuts in Yarnl
2. Check for conflicts with browser shortcuts
3. Check for conflicts with OS-level shortcuts
4. Try a different key combination

## Reset to Defaults

If your shortcuts get messy:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Keyboard Shortcuts**
2. Click **Reset to Defaults**
3. All shortcuts return to their original bindings
