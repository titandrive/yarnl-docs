# Projects

Projects allow you to group multiple patterns together into a single collection. This is useful for larger works that consist of multiple patterns—a blanket made of multiple squares, a doll with separate parts, or a themed collection of related patterns.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Patterns stay in your library** — Adding a pattern to a project creates a reference, not a copy
- **Deleting a project doesn't delete patterns** — Only the project and its associations are removed
- **Project-specific status** — Each pattern can have a different status within each project, independent of its library status

---

## Creating a Project

1. Go to the **Projects** tab
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Add hashtags for organization
5. Add patterns:

<div className="steps-grid">

<div className="step-box">

### Add Existing

Select patterns already in your library using search and filters.

</div>

<div className="step-box">

### Import New

Drag & drop PDF files to upload and add in one step.

</div>

</div>

6. Click **Create Project**

## Project Detail View

Click any project card to open the detail view:

- **Progress bar** — Visual percentage of completed patterns
- **Total time** — Cumulative time tracked across all patterns
- **Hashtags** — Tags applied to the project
- **Pattern list** — All patterns with thumbnails, names, and status dropdowns

### Actions

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Back** | Return to Projects tab |
| **Edit** | Modify name, description, hashtags, or thumbnail |
| **Notes** | Add free-form notes about the project |
| **Add Patterns** | Add more patterns (existing or import new) |
| **Reorder** | Enable drag-and-drop to reorder patterns |

---

## Pattern Status

Each pattern within a project has its own status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Not started yet |
| **In Progress** | Currently working on |
| **Completed** | Finished |

Change status using the dropdown next to each pattern. This status is specific to the project and doesn't affect the pattern's status in your main library.

---

## Reordering Patterns

1. Click **Reorder** in the project detail footer
2. Drag patterns up or down
3. Click **Done Reordering** to save

---

## Project Badges

Project cards display status badges:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **IN PROGRESS** | Project is currently active |
| **COMPLETE** | All patterns finished or manually marked complete |
| **♥** | Marked as favorite |

---

## Adding Patterns

To add patterns to an existing project:

1. Open the project
2. Click **Add Patterns**
3. Choose a tab:
   - **Add Existing** — Browse and select from your library
   - **Import New** — Upload new PDF files
4. Click **Add Selected**

### Duplicate Detection

When importing a PDF that matches an existing pattern name:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Skip** | Don't add this file |
| **Import Anyway** | Create a new pattern from the PDF |
| **Use Existing** | Add the existing library pattern instead |

---

## Editing a Project

Click **Edit** to:

- Change project name or description
- Update hashtags
- Upload a custom thumbnail
- Delete the project

---

## Thumbnails

- **Auto-generated** — Uses the first pattern's thumbnail by default
- **Custom** — Upload your own image in the edit modal

Clear the custom thumbnail to revert to auto-generated.

---

## Archiving

Archive projects you want to hide without deleting. Archived projects can be restored later from **Settings → Archive**.
