Control Yarnl without putting down your hook.

Use keyboard shortcuts or a Bluetooth controller to keep your hands on your work.

## Default Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Increase counter | `↑` | Add one to selected counter |
| Decrease counter | `↓` | Subtract one from selected counter |
| Next counter | `Tab` | Cycle to next counter |
| Previous page | `←` | Go back one page |
| Next page | `→` | Go forward one page |
| Start/Stop timer | `Space` | Toggle project timer |

## Customize Shortcuts

### Setting a New Shortcut

Each command has two shortcut slots. Click on any slot (or the + sign for empty ones), press your desired key, and it's saved.

### Deleting a Shortcut

Right-click (or two-finger click) on a key to clear it.

## Bluetooth Devices

Most Bluetooth controllers work immediately once paired. If your controller sends standard keys (arrows, letters, etc.), Yarnl will detect them automatically.

### Media Controllers

Controllers designed for TikTok or media playback often send media keys (play, pause) instead of standard keys. If yours isn't detected, enable **Bluetooth/Media Remote** at the top of the Keyboard Shortcuts settings.

*Note: Due to browser limitations, you'll need to click on the page once before media keys will work.*
