# Yarnl
Welcome to yarnl. Yarnl was born from my desire to create the perfect crochet app after being endlessly frustrated by what currently exists. It was also the perfect way to combine my two favorite pasttimes: crocheting and self-hosting. 

## Common frustrations 
There are a variety of crochet and pattern tracking apps and websites available but they all suffer from the same issues:
- Clunky design: Many are ugly or just not fun to use.
- Device limitation: Many are iOS or Android specific, limiting where you can use it
- Subscriptions or paywalls: Many lock the better features behind monthly subscriptions or paywalls 
- Data privacy: They all require you to upload your patterns onto their servers or into their apps. Granted, your patterns may not have sensitive personal informaiton. But what happens to your favorite patterns if the website or app stops working?

## Why Yarnl? 
I set out to solve all of these problems with Yarnl and design my perfect crochet companion. So why Yarnl? What makes it so special? 
- Yarnl is open source, self-hosted, and free. Forever. 
- Yarnl was designed from the beginning with data privacy and portability in mind. Yarnl stores your patterns and associated data in easy to understand formats. You can easily take your patterns out of Yarnl or back them up at any time. See data structure LINK for more info. 
- Yarnl is fully responsive and works just as well on a widescreen monitor as it does on your phone. Start working on a pattern at your desk and later pick it up on the train home. Yarnl remembers exactly where you left off including the page and row count. 
- Yarnl is fully customizable (perhaps too customizable). Nearly every aspect of Yarnl can be changed to suit your needs. Fonts, themes, keyboard shortcuts and more can be easily modified to your liking.
