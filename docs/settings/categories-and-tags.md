# Categories & Tags

Organize your pattern library with categories and hashtags.

---

## Categories

Categories are folders for organizing your patterns. Each pattern can belong to one category.

- View all existing categories in the list
- Type a name and click **Add** to create a new category
- Click the delete button on a category to remove it (patterns in that category will become uncategorized)

---

## Hashtags

Hashtags are labels you can apply to patterns. A pattern can have multiple hashtags, making them useful for cross-cutting organization (e.g., #beginner, #amigurumi, #gift).

- View all existing hashtags in the list
- Type a name and click **Add** to create a new hashtag
- Click the delete button on a hashtag to remove it from all patterns
