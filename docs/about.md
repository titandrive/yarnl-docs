# About Yarnl


Hello,

Welcome to yarnl. Yarnl was born from my desire to create the perfect crochet app after being endlessly frustrated by what currently exists. I decided it would be the perfect way to teach myself to code. 

Selfhosting and crochet are my two favorite hobbies that I spend an embarrasing ammount of time doing. So naturally, I decided to make a self-hosted crochet app!
