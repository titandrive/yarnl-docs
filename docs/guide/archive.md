# Archive

A safety net for deleted patterns.

---

## How It Works

When you delete a pattern:

1. **Pattern moves to archive** (not permanently deleted)
2. **Recover anytime** from Settings → Archive
3. **Permanently delete** when you're sure

---

## Managing Archive

Go to **Settings** → **Archive**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Restore** | Move back to library |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove |
| **Delete All** | Clear entire archive |

---

## Settings
