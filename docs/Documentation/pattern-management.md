# Pattern Management

Learn how to build and organize your pattern library in Yarnl.

## Importing Patterns

### Single Pattern Upload

1. Click the **Add Pattern** button
2. Select a PDF file from your computer
3. The pattern is added to your library

### Bulk Import

Have a folder full of patterns? Import them all at once:

1. Click **Add Pattern**
2. Select multiple PDF files (Ctrl/Cmd+click or Shift+click)
3. All selected patterns are imported simultaneously

:::tip
Bulk import is great for migrating from another system or adding a batch of newly purchased patterns.

3. Write your pattern content using Markdown syntax
4. Click **Save**

## Organizing Your Library

### Categories

Categories are broad groupings for your patterns:

| Category | Example Patterns |
|----------|------------------|
| Amigurumi | Stuffed animals, dolls, toys |
| Wearables | Sweaters, hats, scarves, gloves |
| Home Decor | Blankets, pillows, coasters |
| Accessories | Bags, jewelry, keychains |
| Micro | Tiny amigurumi, miniatures |

**To assign a category:**
1. Open the pattern details
2. Select a category from the dropdown
3. The pattern is automatically sorted into that category folder

### Hashtags

Hashtags provide flexible, cross-cutting organization:

**To add hashtags:**
1. Open the pattern details
2. Type hashtags in the tags field (e.g., `#beginner #quick #gift`)
3. Save your changes

**Popular hashtag ideas:**
- Skill level: `#beginner` `#intermediate` `#advanced`
- Time: `#quick-project` `#weekend` `#long-term`
- Purpose: `#gift` `#holiday` `#baby` `#pet`
- Status: `#modified` `#tested` `#frogged`

### Pattern Status

Track where each pattern is in your workflow:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **New** | Just added, haven't started |
| **In Progress** | Currently working on it |
| **Completed** | Finished! |
| **Favorite** | One of your go-to patterns |

**Quick actions:**
- Click the **heart icon** to toggle favorite
- Click the **status badge** to cycle through statuses

## Searching & Filtering

### Search

Use the search bar to find patterns by:
- Pattern name
- Keywords in the content
- Hashtags (prefix with `#`)

### Filters

Narrow down your library with filters:

- **By Category** — Show only Amigurumi, Wearables, etc.
- **By Status** — Show only In Progress, Favorites, etc.
- **By Type** — Show only PDFs or Markdown patterns

Combine multiple filters to find exactly what you're looking for.

## Automatic Folder Organization

When you assign a category to a pattern, Yarnl can automatically organize it into a folder structure:

```
📁 Patterns
├── 📁 Amigurumi
│   ├── Teddy Bear.pdf
│   └── Bunny.pdf
├── 📁 Wearables
│   ├── Winter Hat.pdf
│   └── Mittens.md
└── 📁 Uncategorized
    └── Mystery Pattern.pdf
```

This keeps your library tidy without manual file management.
